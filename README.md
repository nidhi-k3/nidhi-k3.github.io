## About Me

I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with an ECE focus + Theater Studies at Duke ('26) and looking for hardware engineering opportunities where I can design, test and optimize real systems. 

I began my studies in Computer Science at Duke University and quickly discovered I wanted to physically build as well as code. That led me to focus on embedded systems, sensor integration, and hardware design alongside my CS major.

I have designed and developed hardware products, including custom PCBs, microcontroller-based systems (ESP32), sensor arrays (IMU, FSRs), and LED feedback systems. I've also executed test plans, validated hardware performance under real-world conditions, and troubleshot hardware issues.
